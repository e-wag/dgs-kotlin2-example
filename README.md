# DGS Codegen example with new kotlin class generator and MapStruct

This Repository uses [mapstruct-netflix-dgs-spi](https://github.com/e-wag/mapstruct-netflix-dgs-spi) to make proper mapping
between the generated kotlin classes and mapstruct work.

For this repository to work, you need to publish the referenced
repository locally.
